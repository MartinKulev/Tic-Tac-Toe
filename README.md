# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A recreation of the famous game called Tic-tac-toe.

# How to Use the Program
The players take turns entering numbers between 1 and 9. Each number represents one of the nine boxes on the game board.
The boxes on the first row are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The boxes on the second row are numbered 4, 5, and 6. The boxes on the third row are numbered 7, 8, and 9.

# Game Board
The symbol on the board automatically changes with each turn.
For example, if it's User 1's turn and they type "5," an "X" will appear in the middle box. Then, if it's User 2's turn and they type "3," an "O" will appear in the top right corner.
The game continues with each player taking turns, entering valid numbers corresponding to the empty boxes on the board.
If a player enters a number that is already occupied, a number greater than 9, or text instead of a number, an error message will be displayed, and the turn will remain with the same player.
The game continues until one player wins by having three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if all nine boxes have been filled without a winner.
Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe! May the best player win!
