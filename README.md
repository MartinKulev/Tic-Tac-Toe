The players take turn writing the numbers between 1 and 9. Each number represents one of the nine boxes.

The symbol changes each turn automatically.
Let's say user 1 types "5" - an "X" appears in the middle, then user 2 types "3" - a "O" appear on the top right corner.
Then user 1 types "4" - an "X" appear on the left middle box. Then user 2 types "6" - a "O" appear on the right middle box. And so on...
If the user has typed the number of a box, which is already occupied or a number greater than 9 or a text you get an error message.
If an error occurs the turn remains yours.
The game continues until someone has won by 3 of the same symbol on one collumn, on one row, by one of the 2 diagonals or if all 9 boxes have been filled.
